This project is a crucial component of the preparation for the Skills Competency Test (UKK) in a school environment. It is important to note that the success of this project relies heavily on the support and assistance provided by the school. The school played an active role in compiling and providing the set of questions on which this project was developed.

As the project developer, I acknowledge that the school's hard work in providing instructions and materials forms the basis of this project. I followed the guidelines and directions set by the school to ensure that the project met the standards set for the UKK.

The project was developed transparently and with integrity, and I am committed to complying with all applicable rules and policies. It is hoped that this project will positively prepare learners to face the challenges of the Skills Competency Test (UKK).

I want to emphasize that this project is a collaboration between me, the developer, and the school, who provides necessary guidance and support. Thank you to the school for their contribution in assisting this UKK preparation process.
